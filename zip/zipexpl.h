/* Huffman code lookup table entry--this entry is four bytes for machines
   that have 16-bit pointers (e.g. PC's in the small or medium model).
   Valid extra bits are 0..16.  e == 31 is EOB (end of block), e == 32
   means that v is a literal, 32 < e < 64 means that v is a pointer to
   the next table, which codes (e & 31)  bits, and lastly e == 99 indicates
   an unused code.  If a code with e == 99 is looked up, this implies an
   error in the data. */
